# Boxwise

Boxwise is an open-source web-app,
which makes it easy for organisations
to source, store and distribute
donated goods to people in need
in a fair and dignified way.

This is a new version of [the original Drop App used by Drop In The Ocean](https://www.drapenihavet.no/en/the-drop-app-2/). The [original app](https://bitbucket.org/wishingtree/themarket/src/master/) was limited to just managing a single organization. This is a rewrite to support multiple organizations on a centrally hosted system.

Check out [our webpage](https://www.boxwise.co) for more information!

## Setting up development environment

### Install boxwise-doodba

We created [a Boxwise dev-setup](https://github.com/boxwise/boxwise-doodba). It is based on a docker environment for development and production of odoo by Tecnativa. It should just be 5 commands and you are ready to go. You have to have [docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/) and docker-compose installed for this dev-setup.

### Optional settings which still need to be ticked manually

If [Issue #15](https://github.com/boxwise/boxwise_wms/issues/15) is not yet closed then enable the check-boxes related to in the issue in the odoo frontend in the settings / user rights menu by hand.

If you need to print / download pdfs you have to change the system parameter `web.base.url`. Docker is putting a network layer on top. Because of that odoo is assuming the wrong network address of itself and cannot find the pdf converter when you want to download reports. To solve this problem do the following:

    9.1 Run the command (The command only works if the server is running and if you have not renamed the git repo of boxwise-doodba. In that case you have to adjust the name of the odoo docker container in the command.)

        echo http://$(docker inspect -f '{{range .NetworkSettings.Networks}}{{.IPAddress}}{{end}}' boxwise-doodba_odoo_1):8069

    9.2 Save the result in the system parameter `·∫Åeb.base.url` through the odoo interface. Therefore, go to the menu

        Settings / Technical / Parameters / System Parameters

## Where to go from here?

If you want to check out the boxwise frontend - the fancy designs and form - go to

        localhost:11069/

If you want to see all the odoo bits - the odoo backend - go to

        localhost:11069/web?debug

The debug tag opens odoo in developer mode.
